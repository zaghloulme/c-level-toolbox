## Core Workflow

EVERY PROJECT TRACKER STARTS BY GATHERING THE PROJECT DETAILS AND CREATING THE DATABASE WITH THE FULL SCHEMA BEFORE ADDING ANY TASKS -- NEVER ADD PAGES TO A DATABASE THAT IS MISSING PROPERTIES.

### Phase 1: Gather Project Details

Collect these details from the user before building anything:

1. **Project name** -- what is this project called
2. **Notion parent page** -- where should the tracker database live (page name or URL)
3. **Project phases** -- custom phase names, or accept the 5 defaults (Planning, Design, Build, Review, Launch)
4. **Team members** -- list of people who will own tasks (names only; these go in the Owner field)
5. **Timeline** -- overall start date, end date, or phase-level deadlines
6. **Project brief or task list** -- a scope document, brief, bullet list, or verbal description of what needs to get done

If the user provides only items 1 and 2, proceed with all defaults and generate tasks from context. Ask only about missing critical details.

**Brief template for vague requests:**

```
I'll build your project tracker in Notion. Quick answers needed:

1. What is the project name?
2. Which Notion page should I create the tracker under?
3. What are the project phases? (default: Planning, Design, Build, Review, Launch)
4. Who are the team members? (names for task ownership)
5. What is the timeline? (start date, end date, or key deadlines)
6. Do you have a project brief, scope doc, or task list I should use to pre-populate tasks?
```

### Phase 2: Create the Database in Notion

1. Call `notion-search` with the page name or keywords the user provided to locate the parent page
2. Confirm the parent page with the user if multiple matches exist
3. Call `notion-create-database` with the parent page ID and full schema:

**Database title:** `[Project Name] Tracker`

**Properties to create:**

```
Task Name      -> title
Status         -> select
  options: Not Started, In Progress, In Review, Complete, Blocked
  colors:  gray, blue, purple, green, red
Priority       -> select
  options: Urgent, High, Medium, Low
  colors:  red, orange, yellow, gray
Owner          -> rich_text
Due Date       -> date
Project Phase  -> select
  options: [user's custom phases OR defaults: Planning, Design, Build, Review, Launch]
  colors:  blue, purple, orange, green, pink
Description    -> rich_text
Dependencies   -> rich_text
Tags           -> multi_select
  options: milestone, client-facing, internal, content, design, development,
           admin, research, meeting, deliverable
  colors:  red, blue, gray, pink, purple, green, brown, yellow, orange, default
```

4. Verify the database was created by calling `notion-fetch` with the returned database ID

5. Confirm creation to the user:

```
Project tracker created: "[Project Name] Tracker"
Database ID: db_xyz789

Properties configured:
  - Task Name (title)
  - Status (5 stages: Not Started > In Progress > In Review > Complete > Blocked)
  - Priority (4 levels: Urgent, High, Medium, Low)
  - Owner (text)
  - Due Date (date)
  - Project Phase ([number] phases)
  - Description (rich text)
  - Dependencies (rich text)
  - Tags (10 default tags)
```

**IF THE PARENT PAGE IS NOT FOUND:**
- Ask the user for the exact page title or a URL
- Try `notion-search` again with the corrected term
- If still not found, ask the user to share the page with the Notion integration
- **After 3 failed searches, stop and explain:** "I cannot find that page. Please verify the page exists and that the Notion integration has access to it. Check Settings > Connections in Notion."

**IF DATABASE CREATION FAILS:**
- Check the error message for permission issues
- Verify the parent page ID by calling `notion-fetch` on it
- Retry once with the same parameters
- **If it fails again:** "Database creation failed. This usually means the Notion integration does not have permission to create content on that page. Go to the parent page in Notion, click the three-dot menu, go to Connections, and ensure the integration has 'Can edit' access."

### Phase 3: Pre-Populate Tasks from Project Brief

1. Parse the user's project brief, scope document, or task list into discrete tasks
2. For each task, map the data to the schema:
   - **Task Name** -- short, action-oriented (start with a verb: "Design homepage wireframe", "Write onboarding email sequence")
   - **Status** -- default to "Not Started" for all new tasks
   - **Priority** -- infer from context; milestone items and deadline-sensitive tasks get "High" or "Urgent"; default to "Medium"
   - **Owner** -- assign based on user instructions or skill/role matching; leave empty if no team info provided
   - **Due Date** -- calculate from timeline if provided; distribute tasks across phases evenly if only start/end dates given
   - **Project Phase** -- assign based on task nature and project flow
   - **Description** -- extract relevant details, acceptance criteria, or specifications from the brief
   - **Dependencies** -- note if a task explicitly depends on another task (e.g., "Design must complete before Build begins")
   - **Tags** -- infer from task content (e.g., client deliverable = `client-facing` + `deliverable`, research task = `research`)

3. Call `notion-create-pages` to add all tasks to the database

4. Report seeding results:

```
Tasks imported: 20 of 20 successful

  PLANNING (4 tasks):
    Define project requirements          — Medium, Sarah, Due: Mar 10
    Audit existing website analytics     — High, Marcus, Due: Mar 12
    Stakeholder kickoff meeting          — Urgent, Sarah, Due: Mar 7
    Compile brand asset inventory        — Low, Unassigned, Due: Mar 14

  DESIGN (5 tasks): [listed with owner, priority, due date]
  BUILD (7 tasks): [listed with owner, priority, due date]
  REVIEW (2 tasks): [listed with owner, priority, due date]
  LAUNCH (2 tasks): [listed with owner, priority, due date]

Total: 20 tasks | Assigned: 16 | Unassigned: 4 | Milestones: 3
```

**IF THE BRIEF IS VAGUE OR INCOMPLETE:**
- Generate reasonable tasks based on the project type and phases
- Present the generated task list to the user for approval BEFORE creating pages:
  ```
  I generated 18 tasks from your brief. Here is the breakdown by phase:

  PLANNING (3 tasks):
    1. Define target audience and goals — Medium
    2. Audit competitor approach — Medium
    3. Gather brand assets and copy — High

  Want me to proceed, or would you like to add, remove, or modify any tasks?
  ```
- **NEVER create tasks without confirmation when the data is inferred rather than explicit**

**IF BATCH CREATION PARTIALLY FAILS:**
- Report which tasks succeeded and which failed
- Retry each failed task individually with `notion-create-pages`
- If individual retries fail, provide the task details formatted for manual entry

### Phase 4: Set Up Views and Confirm

After the database and tasks are in place, guide the user on setting up filtered views. **Notion MCP does not support creating views programmatically**, so provide exact instructions.

Present these 5 views for the user to create manually:

```
RECOMMENDED VIEWS (create these in Notion):

1. ALL TASKS (Table view)
   - View type: Table
   - Sort: Due Date (ascending)
   - No filter
   - Purpose: Full task list ordered by deadline

2. MY TASKS (Table view)
   - View type: Table
   - Filter: Owner contains [your name]
   - Sort: Due Date (ascending), then Priority (Urgent first)
   - Purpose: Personal task list for each team member

3. THIS WEEK (Table view)
   - View type: Table
   - Filter: Due Date is within the next 7 days AND Status is not "Complete"
   - Sort: Priority (Urgent first), then Due Date (ascending)
   - Purpose: Weekly sprint view showing what needs attention now

4. BY PHASE (Board view)
   - View type: Board
   - Group by: Project Phase
   - Filter: Status is not "Complete"
   - Sort: Priority (Urgent first)
   - Purpose: See active tasks organized by project phase

5. BLOCKED ITEMS (Table view)
   - View type: Table
   - Filter: Status is "Blocked"
   - Sort: Priority (Urgent first)
   - Purpose: Escalation list — resolve blockers before they cascade
```

Deliver a final summary including: database name and ID, task count by phase with date ranges, assigned vs. unassigned count, milestone count, and 3-4 concrete next steps (create views, assign unassigned tasks, review weekly, check blocked items daily).

## Recovery and Troubleshooting

### Notion Search Returns No Results

If `notion-search` cannot find the target parent page:

1. Ask the user for the exact page title (case-sensitive)
2. Try searching with a shorter keyword (e.g., "Projects" instead of "Active Projects Dashboard")
3. Ask the user to confirm the page exists and is not in a private section
4. **If 3 searches fail:** "I cannot locate that page. Please verify the page title and ensure the Notion integration has access. Check Settings > Connections in Notion, find the integration, and confirm the page is shared with it."

### Database Creation Fails

If `notion-create-database` returns an error:

1. Verify the parent page ID by calling `notion-fetch` on it
2. Check for permission errors in the response -- the integration may lack write access
3. Retry once with the same parameters
4. **If it fails again:** "Database creation failed due to a permissions issue. Please go to the parent page in Notion, click the three-dot menu, go to Connections, and ensure the integration has 'Can edit' access."

### Task Seeding Partially Fails

If some tasks fail to create:

1. Report which tasks succeeded and which failed
2. Retry each failed task individually with `notion-create-pages`
3. If individual retries fail, check if a required property is missing or malformed
4. **If retries continue to fail:** Provide the task details formatted for manual entry:
   ```
   Could not import these tasks automatically:

     Set up staging environment — High, Priya, Due: Mar 25

   To add manually: open the tracker database in Notion, click "+ New",
   and enter the details above.
   ```

### Notion API Rate Limits

If you receive rate limit errors during bulk seeding:

1. Pause for 10 seconds between batches
2. Reduce batch size to 5 tasks per `notion-create-pages` call
3. Continue until all tasks are imported
4. **DO NOT skip tasks due to rate limits** -- slow down and retry

### User Wants to Modify the Schema Later

**Notion MCP does not support modifying existing database schemas.** Instruct the user:
- To add a property: open the tracker, click "+" in the header row, choose type, name it
- To modify a property: click the column header, select "Edit property", change type/name/options

### User Wants to Add More Tasks Later

1. Call `notion-fetch` to confirm the database ID and schema
2. Parse the new tasks following the same mapping rules in Phase 3
3. Call `notion-create-pages` to add the new tasks
4. Report the additions and updated totals

### Duplicate Detection

Flag potential duplicates before creating pages. Present them to the user for confirmation. **NEVER create duplicate task records** -- always confirm first.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **DO NOT** create the database without the full property schema -- adding properties after pages exist causes data alignment issues
- **DO NOT** invent task details not present in the brief -- if the brief is vague, present generated tasks for approval first
- **DO NOT** skip the parent page confirmation -- creating a tracker under the wrong page is difficult to undo
- **DO NOT** assign owners that the user did not mention -- leave the Owner field empty for unassigned tasks
- **DO NOT** deliver without the view setup instructions -- the tracker is only valuable when the user can filter and sort tasks
- **DO NOT** set all tasks to "Urgent" or "High" -- a project where everything is urgent has no prioritization at all
- **DO NOT** create views programmatically -- Notion MCP does not support this; provide manual instructions instead
- **DO NOT** promise automated reminders, notifications, or status updates -- this is a database, not a project management app with automations
