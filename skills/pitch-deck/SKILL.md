# Pitch Deck

## Core Principle

EVERY SLIDE MUST COMMUNICATE ONE IDEA IN UNDER 30 WORDS OF BODY TEXT — IF YOU CANNOT SAY IT IN 30 WORDS, SPLIT IT INTO TWO SLIDES.

## Phase 1: Extract Pitch Elements

Gather the six core pitch elements through conversation. Ask the user directly — do not assume or fabricate any business details.

1. **Ask for the business brief** — request a 2-3 sentence description of what the business does, or accept a file/URL the user provides
2. **Extract these six elements** from the conversation:

| Element | What to Capture | Required? |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| **Problem** | Who suffers, what the pain is, why existing solutions fail | Yes |
| **Solution** | What the product/service does, core value proposition | Yes |
| **Market Size** | TAM/SAM/SOM or target audience size | Yes |
| **Traction** | Revenue, users, growth rate, key milestones, testimonials | If available |
| **Team** | Key people, relevant experience, advisors | If available |
| **The Ask** | Funding amount, deal terms, partnership scope, or next steps | Yes |

3. **Identify the deck type** based on context:
   - **Investor deck** — emphasize market size, traction, financials, and funding ask
   - **Client deck** — emphasize problem/solution fit, case studies, pricing, and next steps
   - **Partnership deck** — emphasize mutual benefit, audience overlap, and proposed terms

4. **Present the extraction summary** to the user before proceeding:

```
## Pitch Elements

**Deck type:** Investor pitch
**Problem:** [extracted problem statement]
**Solution:** [extracted solution]
**Market:** [TAM/SAM/SOM or audience size]
**Traction:** [key metrics or "early stage — focusing on vision"]
**Team:** [key people and relevant background]
**The Ask:** [specific amount or action requested]

Ready to build the slide outline? (yes / adjust)
```

**GATE: Do not proceed to Phase 2 until the user confirms the extraction is accurate.**

## Phase 2: Build Slide Outline

Construct a 10-12 slide outline using the standard pitch deck structure. Each slide gets a title and 1-3 bullet points summarizing the content.

1. **Map elements to slides** using this default structure:

| Slide # | Title | Content Guidance | Max Words |
|---------|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1 | Title Slide | Company name, one-line tagline, presenter name, date | 15 |
| 2 | The Problem | Pain point in concrete terms. Use a stat or story. | 30 |
| 3 | The Solution | What you built and why it works. Lead with the outcome. | 30 |
| 4 | How It Works | 3-step process or product screenshot description. Visual-first. | 25 |
| 5 | Market Opportunity | TAM/SAM/SOM with sources. One chart description. | 25 |
| 6 | Business Model | How you make money. Pricing tiers or revenue streams. | 25 |
| 7 | Traction | Key metrics: revenue, users, growth %. Use numbers, not words. | 20 |
| 8 | Competition | 2x2 matrix or comparison table. Show your unique position. | 25 |
| 9 | The Team | Key people, names, one-line bios. 2-4 people max. | 30 |
| 10 | Financials | Revenue projections, unit economics, or key financial metrics. | 25 |
| 11 | The Ask | Specific amount, use of funds breakdown, timeline. | 25 |
| 12 | Contact | Name, email, website, social links. Clean and simple. | 15 |

2. **Adapt for deck type:**
   - **Client deck:** Replace slides 5, 7, 10 with Case Study, Testimonials, Pricing
   - **Partnership deck:** Replace slides 7, 10, 11 with Audience Overlap, Proposed Terms, Mutual Benefits

3. **Submit the outline for review** using the Canva outline review widget:
   - Call `mcp__claude_ai_Canva__request-outline-review` with the slide titles and bullet points
   - Present the interactive review widget to the user
   - Wait for the user to approve or edit the outline through the widget

4. **Apply any changes** the user makes in the review widget before proceeding

**GATE: Do not proceed to Phase 3 until the outline is approved through the review widget.**

## Phase 3: Generate the Presentation

Create the actual presentation in Canva using the approved outline.

1. **Check for brand kit** — call `mcp__claude_ai_Canva__list-brand-kits`. If a kit exists, note the ID. If not, use Canva's default professional styling.

2. **Generate the deck** — call `mcp__claude_ai_Canva__generate-design-structured` with the approved outline, design type "presentation", brand kit ID (if available), and a clean professional style direction.

3. **Retrieve and preview** — call `mcp__claude_ai_Canva__get-design` to confirm creation, then `mcp__claude_ai_Canva__get-design-thumbnail` to share a preview link.

4. **Present the result** with the design link, thumbnail, slide count, and brand kit status. Ask if the user wants refinements or is ready to export.

**GATE: Wait for user feedback before entering Phase 4. If the user is satisfied, skip to Phase 5.**

## Phase 4: Refine the Presentation

Use Canva's editing transactions to make targeted changes.

1. **Get current content** — call `mcp__claude_ai_Canva__get-design-content` to see text and elements on each slide
2. **Start transaction** — call `mcp__claude_ai_Canva__start-editing-transaction` with the design ID
3. **Apply edits** — call `mcp__claude_ai_Canva__perform-editing-operations` for text changes, repositioning, or content swaps
4. **Commit or cancel** — call `commit-editing-transaction` if correct, or `cancel-editing-transaction` and start fresh if something broke
5. **Show updated thumbnail** — call `get-design-thumbnail` so the user can verify

**IMPORTANT:** Make all related edits within a single transaction. Do not open multiple transactions for one round of feedback.

Repeat Phase 4 for each round of user feedback. If 3 refinement rounds do not resolve the issue, stop and reassess — the problem may require manual editing in Canva's UI.

## Phase 5: Export the Deck

Export the final presentation in both PPTX and PDF formats.

1. **Check formats** — call `mcp__claude_ai_Canva__get-export-formats` to confirm PPTX and PDF availability
2. **Export PPTX** — call `mcp__claude_ai_Canva__export-design` with format `pptx` (for PowerPoint, Google Slides, Keynote)
3. **Export PDF** — call `mcp__claude_ai_Canva__export-design` with format `pdf` (for email attachments, investor portals, DocSend)
4. **Deliver both download links** and remind the user the deck is saved in their Canva account for future editing

## Slide-by-Slide Content Guide

Every slide follows the same rule: one idea, visual-first, minimal text.

| Slide | Key Rule | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **1. Title** | Company name large, tagline in one line, presenter + date small at bottom | "WorkflowOS — Operations intelligence for scaling teams" |
| **2. Problem** | Lead with pain. One stat or one-sentence story. Frame as audience's problem. | "The average operations team spends 60% of their week on reporting instead of decisions" |
| **3. Solution** | One sentence + three benefit bullets (not features) | "WorkflowOS surfaces the right data at the right moment for every decision" |
| **4. How It Works** | Three numbered steps, 5-8 words each. Visual-first. | "1. Connect your systems. 2. Set your metrics. 3. Decisions surface automatically." |
| **5. Market** | TAM/SAM/SOM stacked largest to smallest. Cite sources. One visual. | "TAM: $12B. SAM: $3.2B. SOM: $180M." |
| **6. Business Model** | Model in one line. 2-3 pricing tiers. One unit economic metric. | "SaaS: $2,500/mo growth, $6,000/mo enterprise, $15,000/mo custom" |
| **7. Traction** | Numbers only, large font. If pre-revenue: pilots, LOIs, waitlist. | "$85K MRR / 34 enterprise clients / 18% MoM growth" |
| **8. Competition** | 2x2 quadrant, you in top-right. 3-5 named competitors. No bashing. | Axes: "Ease of Implementation" vs "Real-Time Intelligence" |
| **9. Team** | 2-4 people max. Photo, name, title, one credential each. | "Sarah Chen, CEO — Ex-McKinsey, 10 years in enterprise software" |
| **10. Financials** | 3-year projections or run rate. Simple bar chart. Key assumptions small. | "Path to $8M ARR in 24 months" |
| **11. The Ask** | Exact amount. Use-of-funds breakdown (3-4 categories as %). Timeline. | "$4M Series A. 45% product, 35% GTM, 15% team, 5% ops" |
| **12. Contact** | Name, email, website, social. One closing line. No clutter. | "Let's build the operating system for your organization." |

## Example 2: Consultant Client Pitch

**User says:** "I'm a brand strategy consultant and I need a pitch deck for a potential client — a D2C skincare company that wants to rebrand. I want to show them my process and pricing."

**Phase 1 extraction presented to user:**
```
**Deck type:** Client pitch
**Problem:** D2C skincare brands struggle to differentiate — generic branding leads to low recall and high acquisition costs
**Solution:** Full-service brand strategy — positioning, visual identity, messaging, launch playbook
**Traction:** 12 brand projects completed, 3 in skincare, average 35% improvement in brand recall
**Team:** Solo consultant — 8 years at Pentagram + Collins, 3 years independent
**The Ask:** $25,000 engagement over 8 weeks (audit, strategy, delivery)
```

**Phase 2 outline (adapted for client deck):**
1. Brand Strategy for [Client Name] — by [Consultant Name]
2. The Challenge — Standing out in a crowded market
3. My Approach — Positioning-first brand strategy
4. How We Work Together — Audit, Strategy, Delivery (8 weeks)
5. Case Study — GlowLab: 42% increase in brand recall
6. Case Study — BeautyStack: 28% lower acquisition cost after rebrand
7. Testimonials — What clients say
8. The Deliverables — What you get at the end of 8 weeks
9. About Me — 8 years at Pentagram + Collins, 3 years independent
10. Investment — $25,000 for the full engagement
11. Next Steps — Sign by Friday, kick off Monday
12. Contact — email, portfolio, LinkedIn

**Phase 3-5:** Deck generated with professional default styling. Exported as PPTX + PDF. 12 slides, ready to send to the prospect.

## Anti-Patterns

- **DO NOT** put more than 30 words of body text on any slide — pitch decks are visual, not documents
- **DO NOT** exceed 12 slides — attention drops sharply after slide 10; every slide beyond 12 must justify its existence
- **DO NOT** skip the Ask slide — the entire deck builds to this moment; leaving it out wastes the audience's time
- **DO NOT** use generic stock imagery descriptions — every visual element should reinforce the specific business story
- **DO NOT** cram financial projections into a wall of numbers — pick 3-4 key metrics and make them large
- **DO NOT** list features instead of benefits on the Solution slide — investors and clients buy outcomes, not feature lists
- **DO NOT** include more than 4 team members — highlight founders and key hires only
- **DO NOT** present multiple pricing options on the Ask slide for investor decks — state one clear number and the use of funds

## Recovery

**Design generation fails:** Retry once with the same parameters. If it fails again, simplify to 10 slides (drop Competition and Financials) and retry. If 3 attempts fail, stop and reassess — offer to write slide content as a markdown file for manual import.

**Outline review widget does not load:** Present the outline as a numbered list in chat. Ask the user to approve or edit via text. Proceed with the text-confirmed outline.

**Editing transaction fails to commit:** Call `cancel-editing-transaction` to clean up. Start a fresh transaction and re-apply. If 3 transactions fail on the same edit, skip it and note it for the user to fix in Canva.

**Export fails:** Call `get-export-formats` to check available formats. If PPTX is unavailable, export PDF only. If both fail, provide the Canva design link for manual export.

**No brand kit found:** Proceed with Canva's default professional styling. Inform the user they can apply their brand kit later in Canva's editor.

**Brief is too vague:** Ask three questions: (1) Who is your target customer? (2) What do they pay you for? (3) What should the audience do after this deck? Do not proceed until Problem, Solution, and Ask are clear.
