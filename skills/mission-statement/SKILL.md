## Toolbox rules

Before starting: silently read `user-config.md` in the current directory. Match the user's tone preference and the "what to avoid" notes. If it does not exist, tell the user to run `/setup` first, then stop.

When multiple paths could work, pick the best one and state it in one line. Do not present a numbered list of choices for the user to pick from.

Follow the writing rules in `CLAUDE.md` at the plugin root: banned words, active voice, concrete over abstract, no formatting slop.

# Mission Statement

## Deliverable requirements (hard)

The output MUST include all four components — never only the polished statements:

1. **Mission, Vision, Values statements** — the polished final language.
2. **Stakeholder input process** — a concrete plan for how to gather input from the leadership team, employees, and customers (methods, timeline, sample questions).
3. **Alignment exercises** — 2-3 facilitation exercises the leader can run with their team to pressure-test whether the statements resonate (e.g., decision-rehearsal, gap-analysis, "would the customer recognize us?").
4. **Decision-filter guide** — how the values translate into daily decisions, with 4-6 worked examples of how a specific values statement resolves a specific tradeoff.

A polished MVV without the process, exercises, and decision-filter is an incomplete deliverable.

## Core Principle

A MISSION STATEMENT THAT LIVES ON A WALL BUT NOT IN DAILY DECISIONS IS DECORATION — THE REAL TEST IS WHETHER EVERY TEAM MEMBER CAN USE IT TO DECIDE WHAT TO SAY YES AND NO TO.

## Phase 1: Brief

### Required Inputs

| Input | What to Ask | Default |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Organization** | "What is the organization or business?" | No default — must be provided |
| **Current mission** | "Do you have an existing mission statement? If so, what is it?" | None — starting fresh |
| **Who you serve** | "Who is your primary audience or beneficiary?" | No default — must be provided |
| **What you do** | "What is the core activity or service you provide?" | No default — must be provided |
| **Why it matters** | "What change do you create in the world?" | No default — must be provided |
| **Stakeholders** | "Who should have input? (leadership only, team, board, customers)" | Leadership only |

**GATE: Confirm the brief before proceeding.**

## Phase 2: Discovery

### Stakeholder Input Process

If multiple stakeholders are involved:

```
## Stakeholder Questions (send to each person)
1. In one sentence, what does this organization exist to do?
2. Who do we serve, and what do they need from us?
3. What makes us different from others doing similar work?
4. What would the world lose if we disappeared tomorrow?
5. What three words describe how we do our work?
```

### Foundation Elements

Extract from inputs:

```
## Mission Foundation
**Who we serve:** [Specific audience]
**What we do:** [Core activity]
**Why it matters:** [The change we create]
**How we are different:** [Our unique approach]
**What guides us:** [Core values themes]
```

### Mission vs. Vision vs. Values

Define each clearly before writing:

```
**Mission:** What we do today and for whom (present tense)
**Vision:** The future state we are working toward (future tense)
**Values:** How we behave and make decisions (principles)
```

**GATE: Present the foundation elements and get alignment before writing.**

## Phase 3: Write

### Mission Statement Formula

Use one of these structures:

**Formula 1: We [action] for [audience] so that [impact].**
Example: "We provide free legal aid to immigrant families so they can navigate the system with dignity."

**Formula 2: [Organization] exists to [action] by [method] for [audience].**
Example: "Meridian exists to accelerate workforce development by making skills training accessible to mid-career professionals."

**Formula 3: To [impact statement] through [method].**
Example: "To eliminate preventable blindness through affordable eye care in underserved communities."

### Mission Statement Rules

- One sentence, under 25 words if possible
- Present tense — what you do now, not what you aspire to
- Specific enough to guide decisions
- No jargon, buzzwords, or corporate-speak
- Anyone on the team should be able to repeat it from memory

### Vision Statement

- One to two sentences
- Future tense — the world you are creating
- Ambitious but believable
- Inspires without being vague

```
Example: "A world where every organization has the tools to compete on quality of execution, regardless of size."
```

### Values (3-5 maximum)

For each value:

```
## [Value Name]
**What it means:** [One sentence definition]
**What it looks like:** [Observable behavior]
**What it does NOT mean:** [Common misinterpretation]
```

Example:
```
## Speed Over Perfection
**What it means:** We ship fast and iterate based on real feedback.
**What it looks like:** Launching an MVP in 2 weeks instead of a polished product in 6 months.
**What it does NOT mean:** Being careless or skipping quality checks.
```

## Phase 4: Polish

### 1. Stress Test

Test the mission statement against these scenarios:

```
## Decision Filter Test
Can this mission statement help you answer:
- [ ] "Should we launch this new product?" (Does it serve our audience in our way?)
- [ ] "Should we take this partnership?" (Does it align with our mission?)
- [ ] "Should we hire this person?" (Do they believe in this mission?)
- [ ] "Should we pivot?" (Are we still serving the same need?)

If the mission cannot help answer these, it is too vague.
```

### 2. Stakeholder Alignment

Present 2-3 mission statement options for the stakeholder group to review. Include:
- Why each option was written
- What each option emphasizes
- Recommendation with rationale

### 3. Implementation Guide

```
## Putting the Mission to Work
- Add to website, email signatures, and key documents
- Open team meetings with a mission moment (share a story that exemplifies it)
- Use in hiring: ask candidates what the mission means to them
- Reference in strategy discussions: "Does this align with our mission?"
- Review annually — if the organization evolves, the mission may need to as well
```

## Example 1: Tech Education Nonprofit

```
Mission: "We teach underserved youth to code so they can build their own futures."
Vision: "A tech industry that reflects the diversity of the communities it serves."
Values: Access, Excellence, Community
```

## Example 2: Professional Services Firm

```
Mission: "We give growing organizations the financial clarity to make confident decisions."
Vision: "A world where every leadership team makes resource decisions based on real data, not instinct."
Values: Precision, Candor, Client Outcomes First
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Committee-written statements** — too many cooks produce generic mush. One person drafts, the group refines.
- **Buzzword soup** — "We create next-generation solutions to help stakeholders unlock growth" means nothing. Use plain language.
- **Too long** — if it takes more than 10 seconds to say, no one will remember it. Keep it tight.
- **Too vague** — "We make the world a better place" could apply to any organization. Be specific about who and how.
- **Aspirational mission** — the mission is what you do NOW. The vision is the future. Do not confuse them.
- **Values without behaviors** — "Integrity" on a wall means nothing without "what integrity looks like here."

## Recovery

- **Stakeholders cannot agree:** Find the overlap. Ask "What do ALL of you agree we exist to do?" Start from shared ground.
- **Existing mission is sacred but outdated:** Position the update as "evolving" not "replacing." Keep the core intent, modernize the language.
- **User wants more than 5 values:** Force-rank them. If everything is a value, nothing is. Pick the 3-5 that actually guide decisions.
- **User keeps adding words:** Challenge every word. Ask "If we removed this word, would the meaning change?" If not, cut it.
