### Status Flow

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Backlog | Idea captured, no timeline | Score with ICE, assign priority |
| Planned | Committed to a quarter | Assign owner, refine description |
| In Progress | Actively being built | Owner provides progress updates |
| Testing | Built, undergoing QA or beta | Testers provide feedback within 5 days |
| Shipped | Live and available to users | Mark release date in Description |
| Deferred | Intentionally postponed | Log reason, revisit next quarter |

### Effort Sizing

XS = less than 1 day | Small = 1-3 days | Medium = 1-2 weeks | Large = 3-4 weeks | XL = 5+ weeks

## ICE Scoring Framework

DEFAULT PRIORITIZATION METHOD. Use ICE unless the user explicitly requests MoSCoW-only.

**ICE Score = (Impact x Confidence x Ease) / 10**

| Dimension | Question | Scale |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Impact | How much does this move the needle on revenue, retention, or satisfaction? | 1 (minimal) to 10 (transformative) |
| Confidence | How certain are we this will deliver the expected impact? | 1 (pure guess) to 10 (validated with data) |
| Ease | How easy is this to implement given current resources? | 1 (massive effort) to 10 (trivial to ship) |

| ICE Range | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 50-100 | Prioritize immediately; move to Now |
| 25-49 | Plan for Next quarter |
| 10-24 | Keep in Later; refine scope |
| 1-9 | Move to Icebox; revisit when data improves |

**Scoring rules:**
- Score Impact on **business outcomes**, not feature appeal. A billing fix that reduces churn outscores a flashy animation.
- Score Confidence on **evidence.** Customer interviews = 8-10, gut feeling = 2-3, competitor has it = 5-6.
- Score Ease **relative to team size.** A solo developer rates a 2-week feature as 3; a 5-person team rates it 7.
- **NEVER give every feature the same scores.** If all features score 5/5/5, the framework provides zero signal.

## Core Workflow

EVERY PRODUCT ROADMAP STARTS BY GATHERING PRODUCT DETAILS AND CREATING THE DATABASE WITH THE FULL 12-PROPERTY SCHEMA BEFORE ADDING ANY FEATURES — NEVER ADD PAGES TO A DATABASE THAT IS MISSING PROPERTIES.

### Phase 1: Gather Product Details

1. **Product name** — what is the product called
2. **Product type** — SaaS, mobile app, web app, online course, physical product, marketplace
3. **Current stage** — idea, MVP, beta, launched, scaling
4. **Notion parent page** — where should the roadmap live (page name or URL)
5. **Feature list** — known features, ideas, or backlog items to import
6. **Team size** — small (2-5), medium (6-15), or large (16+); affects Ease scoring
7. **Release cadence** — weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, or milestone-based
8. **Stakeholder audience** — who will read this (team, investors, customers, board)
9. **Custom categories** — product areas beyond the 6 defaults

If the user provides only items 1, 4, and 5, proceed with all defaults.

**Brief template:**
```
I'll build your product roadmap in Notion. Quick answers needed:
1. Product name?
2. Product type? (SaaS, app, course, physical, other)
3. Current stage? (idea, MVP, beta, launched, scaling)
4. Which Notion page should I create the roadmap under?
5. Feature list or backlog to import?
6. Team size? (2-5, 6-15, 16+)
7. Release cadence? (weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly)
8. Who will read this roadmap? (team, investors, customers, board)
```

### Phase 2: Prioritize Features with ICE Scoring

1. Score every feature with Impact, Confidence, Ease (1-10 each)
2. Calculate ICE Score: (I x C x E) / 10
3. Assign MoSCoW Priority: ICE 50+ = Must Have, 25-49 = Should Have, 10-24 = Could Have, below 10 = Won't Have
4. Assign Quarter/Phase: Must Have -> Now, Should Have -> Now/Next, Could Have -> Next/Later, Won't Have -> Icebox
5. Present scored list for user approval:

```
 #  Feature                    Impact  Conf  Ease  ICE   Priority      Phase
 1  Stripe payment integration    9      8     6   43.2  Must Have     Now
 2  Email onboarding sequence     8      7     7   39.2  Should Have   Now
 3  Team member roles             7      6     5   21.0  Could Have    Next
 4  Dark mode                     3      4     8    9.6  Won't Have    Icebox

Approve this prioritization, or tell me which scores to adjust.
```

**NEVER skip prioritization.** Even if the user says "just add them all," score every feature first.

### Phase 3: Search Notion for Parent Page

1. Call `notion-search` with the page name the user provided
2. Confirm the parent page if multiple matches exist

**IF NOT FOUND:** Ask for exact title, try shorter keywords, verify integration access. After 3 failures: "I cannot locate that page. Check Settings > Connections in Notion and verify the integration has access."

### Phase 4: Create the Roadmap Database

1. Call `notion-create-database` with parent page ID, title `[Product Name] Roadmap`, and all 12 properties from the schema above (including color assignments)
2. Verify with `notion-fetch` on the returned database ID
3. Confirm creation with property summary

**IF CREATION FAILS:** Verify parent page ID with `notion-fetch`, check permissions, retry once. If it fails again: "Please go to the parent page > three-dot menu > Connections and ensure the integration has 'Can edit' access."

### Phase 5: Seed Features and Deliver

1. Using the approved scored list from Phase 2, call `notion-create-pages` for all features
2. Populate all 12 properties per feature. Must Have/Now features start as "Planned"; all others start as "Backlog"
3. Report results grouped by Quarter/Phase with feature name, priority, effort, ICE score, and owner
4. Provide view setup instructions (Notion MCP cannot create views programmatically):

```
RECOMMENDED VIEWS:

1. TIMELINE VIEW (Table) — Group by: Quarter/Phase, Sort: Priority then ICE descending, Filter: not Deferred
2. PRIORITY BOARD (Board) — Group by: Priority, Sort: Impact descending, Filter: not Shipped/Deferred
3. STATUS KANBAN (Board) — Group by: Status, Sort: Priority, No filter
4. QUICK WINS (Table) — Filter: Impact >= 7 AND Ease >= 7 AND Status = Backlog, Sort: Ease descending
```

5. Deliver the planning guide:

```
QUARTERLY REVIEW (60 min):
1. Move shipped features to "Shipped"
2. Re-score features whose Impact/Confidence changed
3. Pull top Backlog features into "Planned" for next quarter
4. Assign owners to all "Now" features

WEEKLY CHECK-IN (15 min):
1. Update statuses in Status Kanban
2. Check for blocked features (note in Dependencies)
3. Review Quick Wins for fast shipping opportunities

ADDING NEW IDEAS: Set Status=Backlog, Phase=Icebox, score ICE, assign Priority

STAKEHOLDER VIEWS:
- Board/Investors: filter Must Have + Should Have, hide ICE scores
- Customers: filter Now + Next, show Status and Quarter only
- Internal: show all views, full detail
```

**IF THE FEATURE LIST IS VAGUE:** Generate reasonable features based on product type and stage, present with ICE scores for approval BEFORE creating pages. NEVER create inferred features without confirmation.

## Example 1: SaaS Invoicing Tool Roadmap

**User:** "Building a SaaS invoicing tool called BillFlow. Post-MVP with 50 beta users. Team: me (product), Priya (engineer), Marcus (designer). Monthly releases. Notion page: 'BillFlow Product'. Here are 12 features..."

**Execution:**

1. **Gather:** BillFlow, SaaS, post-MVP, 3-person team, monthly, internal audience
2. **Prioritize:** Score 12 features:

```
 #  Feature                       Impact  Conf  Ease  ICE    Priority      Phase
 1  Payment reminder emails          8      8     7   44.8   Must Have     Now
 2  Stripe payment integration       9      8     6   43.2   Must Have     Now
 3  CSV export for accountants       6      7     7   29.4   Should Have   Now
 4  Recurring invoice automation     9      7     5   31.5   Should Have   Now
 5  Dashboard with revenue metrics   7      6     6   25.2   Should Have   Now
 6  Late fee auto-calculation        6      7     5   21.0   Could Have    Next
 7  Team member roles                7      6     5   21.0   Could Have    Next
 8  Custom invoice templates         5      6     6   18.0   Could Have    Next
 9  QuickBooks sync                  8      5     4   16.0   Could Have    Next
10  Dark mode                        2      9     8   14.4   Could Have    Later
11  Client self-service portal       7      5     4   14.0   Could Have    Later
12  Multi-currency support           6      4     3    7.2   Won't Have    Icebox
```

3. **Search:** `notion-search` "BillFlow Product" -> `pg_billflow123`
4. **Create:** Database "BillFlow Roadmap" with custom categories (Core, Billing, Reporting, Integrations, UX) -> `db_roadmap456`
5. **Seed and deliver:**

```
Features imported: 12 of 12

  NOW: Payment reminder emails (Must, ICE 44.8), Stripe integration (Must, ICE 43.2),
       Recurring invoices (Should, ICE 31.5), CSV export (Should, ICE 29.4),
       Dashboard metrics (Should, ICE 25.2)
  NEXT: Late fees (Could, ICE 21.0), Team roles (Could, ICE 21.0),
        Invoice templates (Could, ICE 18.0), QuickBooks sync (Could, ICE 16.0)
  LATER: Dark mode (Could, ICE 14.4), Client portal (Could, ICE 14.0)
  ICEBOX: Multi-currency (Won't, ICE 7.2)

Next steps:
1. Create the 4 recommended views in Notion
2. Assign owners to the 3 unassigned features
3. Write detailed specs for the 2 Must Have features
4. Schedule quarterly review for end of this quarter
```

## Example 2: Enterprise Internal Tool Roadmap

**User:** "Building an internal analytics dashboard for our operations team, post-MVP with 30 internal users. Team of 6. Quarterly releases. Notion page: 'Ops Analytics'. Here are 8 features..."

**Prioritize:** Score 8 features (team of 6 = mid-range Ease scores):

```
 #  Feature                         Impact  Conf  Ease  ICE    Priority      Phase
 1  Real-time KPI dashboard            9      8     7   50.4   Must Have     Now
 2  Automated weekly report emails     7      7     8   39.2   Should Have   Now
 3  Core data pipeline (12 sources)   10      9     4   36.0   Must Have     Now
 4  Alert thresholds + notifications   8      7     6   33.6   Should Have   Now
 5  Exportable PDF reports             5      8     8   32.0   Should Have   Now
 6  Team-level access controls         6      6     7   25.2   Could Have    Next
 7  Predictive trend analysis          8      4     3    9.6   Won't Have    Icebox
 8  External client portal             6      3     5    9.0   Won't Have    Icebox
```

```

## Recovery and Troubleshooting

### Notion Search Returns No Results
1. Ask for the exact page title (case-sensitive)
2. Try a shorter keyword (e.g., "Product" instead of "BillFlow Product Dashboard")
3. Confirm the page is shared with the Notion integration
4. After 3 failures: "Check Settings > Connections in Notion and verify the integration has access."

### Database Creation Fails
1. Verify parent page ID with `notion-fetch`
2. Check for permission errors
3. Retry once
4. If it fails again: "Go to parent page > three-dot menu > Connections > ensure 'Can edit' access."

### Feature Seeding Partially Fails
1. Report which features succeeded and which failed
2. Retry failed features individually
3. If retries fail, provide details formatted for manual entry

### Notion API Rate Limits
1. Pause 10 seconds between batches, reduce to 5 features per call
2. **DO NOT skip features due to rate limits** — slow down and retry

### User Disagrees with ICE Scores
1. Ask which features to re-score and discuss their reasoning
2. Adjust scores, recalculate ICE, re-sort priorities
3. Present revised list for approval before proceeding

## Anti-Patterns

- **DO NOT** create the database without the full 12-property schema — adding properties after pages exist causes alignment issues
- **DO NOT** skip ICE scoring — prioritization is the core value of a roadmap, not the list itself
- **DO NOT** use dates that imply commitments unless the user confirms deadlines — use relative horizons (Now, Next, Later), not calendar dates
- **DO NOT** add more than 20 features without grouping into categories — uncategorized lists are backlog dumps, not roadmaps
- **DO NOT** assign all features to "Now" — if everything is Now, nothing is prioritized
- **DO NOT** give every feature the same ICE scores — identical scores defeat the framework
- **DO NOT** skip parent page confirmation — creating under the wrong page is difficult to undo
- **DO NOT** create views programmatically — Notion MCP does not support this
- **DO NOT** promise automated notifications, sprint planning, or burndown charts — this is a database, not a full PM tool
